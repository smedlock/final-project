# snake-game

This is a final project for a Fullstack Web Development course, implementing an MVC pattern in the FatFree Framework and utilizing OOP, PDO objects to interact with the database layer, and JQuery/AJAX. The project built a site with a user registration system, keeping track of various scores for a snake game. If a user selects 'premium' at the time of registration, they will be able to see the number of cells they've traveled and the total amount of food they've consumed; otherwise, the site keeps track of their highest score.
